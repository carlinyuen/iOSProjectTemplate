iOSProjectTemplate
==================

Organized, clean, boilerplate template for my iOS Xcode projects.
Keywords: ios, xcode, template, boilerplate, project, organization

I break things into the following folders to simplify and try to organize things
in a reasonable manner:

Root Level
 * AppDelegate.h/.m
 * AppViewController.h/.m (root controller)
 * Constants.h/.m (according to best practices)
 * Functions.h (useful utility functions)
 * Libraries (any third party libraries you might use)
 * Models (self-explanatory, according to MVC pattern)
 * Resources
   * images (all lumped in one big folder, I find it easier to manage & update)
   * fonts
 * Views & Controllers (I find it easier to navigate & manage this way)

Feel free to take it & use it if you find it useful / like the style.
